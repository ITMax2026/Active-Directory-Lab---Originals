Goal: Centralize print management on the Server (DC01) and automate printer mapping for end-users based on their Department/Security Group
 
Deployment Strategy: Group Policy with Item-Level Targeting
  - Instead of creating a seperate GPO for every department (which creates 'GPO Bloat') we use a single GPO with Item-Level Targeting based on Security Groups.
  - This allows the GPO to evaluate 'Is this user in HR?' before mapping the printer
  * Result: Users only see the printes relevant to their job function (Security Group)

Purpose:
  - In a production environment, manually installing printers on individual workstations is inefficient.
  - This setup achieves 'Zero-Touch Provisioning':  An HR employee simply logs in, and the correct print drivers and settings are automatically configured


Part 1: Install the Print Server Role - On the Server
 1. Open Server Manager > Manage > Add Roles and Features
 2. Click through the wizard, making sure DC01 is selected
 3. At Server Roles > Select Print and Documet Services
 4. Click through the wizard > At Role Services make sure Print Server is selected
 5. Install

Part 2: Driver Setup and Printer Creation - On the Client
 Step 1 - Add DC01 to the Print  
  1. Open Print Management (printmanagement.msc)
  2. Right Click Print Servers > Add/Remove Servers
  3. In Add Servers > Write DC01 > Click Add to List

 Step 2 - Create a Fake Port
 1. Expand DC01 > Right click Ports > Add Port...
 2. Select Standard TCP/IT Port > New Port... > Next
 3. Printer Name or IP Address: Pick an address not in use from your subnet
    - My Server is 192.168.242.10 > So make the printer 192.168.242.100
 4. It will try to detect the device.  It will fail.  Just wait a few seconds
 5. When it finishes > choose Custom > Next > Finish

 Step 3 - Install a 'Real' Driver
 1. Google HP Universal Print Driver (PCL6) > Download the Driver from the HP website.
 2. Extract the folder and look for a .inf file.  You will see several .inf files.  You are looking for :
    - Prefix: hpcu - HP Core Universal
    - Ending: u - Universal
    - In my case it's a hpcu345u.inf file
 3. Right click Drivers > Add Driver
 4. Click through until you see Printer Driver Selection and select Have Disk

 Step 4 - Create the Printer
 1. Expand DC01 > Right click Printers > Add Printer
 2. Select Add a new printer using an existing port:
   - Select the IP Port you created earlier - 192.168.242.100
 3 Select Use an existing printer driver on the computer
    - Select HP Universal Printing PCL 6
  4. Driver: Install a new driver > Manufacturer: Generic > Generic/Text Only
  5. Naming:
     - Printer Name: Sales-Printer-HP
     - Share Name: Sales-Printer-HP
     - Check: Share this printer
   6. After installation:
     - Right click > Properties > Sharing > Click List in the directory
    
 Part 4: Create the GPO with Item-Level Targeting 
  Step 1: Create the GPO
   1. Open Group Policy Management
   2. Right click DemoCorp OU > Click 'Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here..'
   3. Create a GPO: Named 'U_MapPrinter'
     * We are linking to DemoCorp because users are scattered in multiple OUs.  Linking at the top ensures the policy applies to everyone and the later Targeting will filter access to the right users
  
  Step 2: Create Sales Staff Security Group (We only have IT Admins and HR Staff right now)
   1. Right click Groups folder > New > Group
   2. Group Name: G_Sales_Staff
   3. Leave default Group Scope: Global /  Group Type: Security
   4. Right click G_Sales_Staff > Properties > Members
   5. Click Add > Search for Charlie Sales

  Step 3: Set up the Printer Mapping
   1. Right Click the GPO > Edit
   2. User Configuration > Preferences > Control Panel Settings > Printers
   3. Right click white space > New > Shared Printer
      A. General Tab:
       - Action: Update
       - Share path: \\DC01\Sales-Printer-HP
      B. Common Tab:
       - Check Run on logged-in user's security context
       - Check Item-level targeting > Click Targeting
       - Click New Item > Security Group
       - Click ... > search for G_Sales_Staff > Click OK
       - It shoud read: "the user is a member of the security group AD\G_Sales_Staff".
     
 Part 5: Verification
  Test 1: Sales User - (Positive)
    - Log in as Charlie Sales
    - System > Bluetooth & Devices > Printers & SCanners >  Sales-Printer-HP should be listed

  Test 2: IT Staff User (Negative
    - Log in as Bob Builder
    - System > Bluetooth & Devices > Printers & SCanners >  Sales-Printer-HP should be absent
