Next Steps: (This is covered in part 5 as well)
You have staged two GPOs, but for Part 5 (Testing) to work, you must remember GPO Application Rules:
  New User rule: Since jhr is inside the General_Staff OU, the Control Panel block will apply to him immediately.
  New Computer rule (Important): When you join a Client VM in the next step, it will default to the generic "Computers" folder. You will have to drag the object into your Workstations OU.
