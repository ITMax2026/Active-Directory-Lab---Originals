part 15

Goal: Move a legacy On-Prem Windows 11 Workstation into a Hybrid Joined state (connected to both Active Direcotry and Entra ID) and have it automatically enroll into Microsoft Intune for cloud management
Part 1: Configure the Service Connection Point (SCP)
Before Intune can manage the device, Entra ID needs to see the device
Log into AADC-01 - the Entra Connect Server
Open Microsoft Entra Connect > Click Configure
Select Configure device options > Next
Connect to Entra ID join with you admin account and password
Device Options: Configure Hybrid Microsoft Entra ID join
Device Operating System: Windows 10 or later
SCP Configuration
Select ad.lab
Authentication Service: Microsoft Entra ID *The SCP creates a record in Active Directory of your specific Tenant ID (Azure GUID) and Tenand Domain Name (ie ADLabs026.onmicrosoft.com) *Of Note: -SCP handles the Computer's Map - it's tell the physical hardware (Client-01) they are Hybrid Joined - result AzureADJoined: Yes -UPN handles the User's Credentials - it allows a User (Jeff Admin) to prove who he is to the cloud - result AzureADPrt: Yes *If you don't follow the instructions in section 12.5 you will try to log in with @ad.lab which isn't a real internet domain and you won't get a PRT
Part 2: Computer Object Syncronization (Checking work implemented in Lab 12)
In the cloud > Go to Entra Admin Center > Devices > All Devices
Search for Client-01: It should be there
Search of AADC-01: It should not be there
Intune is designed for Client OS (Windows 10/11, iOS, Android). Azure Arc is designed for Servers
When you look at 'All Devices' list in the cloud, you want to see all Endpoints (laptops/desktops/mobile), not backend infrastructure
If you don't see Client-01:
Open Microsoft Entra Connect from the desktop
Click Configure > Customize syncronization options
Log in with your Global Admin credentials
On the Domain/OU Filtering screen > Ensure 'Workstations' OU is checked
Part 3: Automated Enrollment via Group Policy (GPO)
This policy creates a link to computers in the Workstations OU and automatically enrolls it in MDM (Microsoft Intune)
Go to the Group Policy Management Console on DC01
Create a new GPO named "Intune Auto Enrollment" linked to the Workstations OU
Policy Path: Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > MDM
Setting:
Enabled: "Enable automatic MDM enrollment using default Microsoft Entra credentials"
Select Credential Type: User Credentials
Part 4: Verification
Native Diagnostic
Run dsregcmd /status
Confirm AzureAdJoined: YES (Hybrid link active)
Confirm AzureAdPrt: YES (User Identity Authenticated)
Confirm MdmUrl populated (MDM discovery successful)
Device UI:
Setting > Accounts > Access work or school
Confirm the presence of the 'Info' button
