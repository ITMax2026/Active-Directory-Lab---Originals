Goal: Set up RSAT on Client-01 so that you don't have to either directly log into the DC01 Server or don't have RDP into DC01 for managing Active Directory.
Purpose:  In a production environments, logging into a Domain Controller (the DC01 Server) for daily tasks, like resetting passwords, is a huge security risk.  
  Instead, you set up secure a Admin workstation (Client-01) that can modify the Domain Controller with RSAT, as needed.
  *We will also use RSAT for future labs in addition to RDP
