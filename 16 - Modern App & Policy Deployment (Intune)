Lab 16 – Intune Device Management

Objective
- Transition device management from legacy on-premises Group Policy (GPO) to Microsoft Intune.
- Demonstrate that security policies and software can be successfully deployed to a Hybrid-joined device over the open internet.

Purpose
- As organizations shift toward remote and hybrid work, relying on local Domain Controllers for policy configuration is no longer practical or scalable.

Why Intune Is Replacing Active Directory GPO
- In an on-premises environment, a device must be connected to the corporate network or VPN to receive Group Policy updates.
- If a user works remotely for an extended period, the device can become unmanaged and unpatched.

Technical Strategy
1. Device Hardening
   - Use Intune Settings to create a modern GPO that restricts device features for security compliance.

2. Automated Provisioning (App Deployment)
   - Use the Microsoft Store (new) to deploy applications such as Microsoft Company Portal without requiring user interaction or local deployment tools.
