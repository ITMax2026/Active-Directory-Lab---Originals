This is a unique section.  This is an unplanned section and something I'm only writing after the fact. 

The Goal of this section:  Make users aware of the conflicts that will arise with Microsoft default security setting, why they are in place and how to manage this issue.

1. The Operational Challenge:
  - The project goal was to implement a "Smart" security posture, requiring MFA for most access but relaxing it for Trusted Locations (e.g., the secure home lab network).
  - However, I found that our attempts to customize these rules were being overridden by Microsoft’s pre-configured "Security Defaults" and Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies
  - Later, I realized this rigidity would also impact Part 15 (Intune), where these same default policies would block devices from silently enrolling in management.

2. Understanding the Defaults - Two Overlapping Layers
   1. Security Defaults
     - Microsoft Entra ID comes with 'Security Defaults' enabled.
     - Philospophy: Microsoft has explicitly stated it is for small organizations without dedicated IT or security staff.
     - When enabled, it automatically applies:
        Mandatory MFA for:
          All admins
          All users
        Blocking legacy authentication (POP, IMAP, basic auth)
        Protection of privileged accounts
        Basic identity risk mitigation
      - You cannot tune these settings individually.
    2. Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies - Turned on by default
        - Block legacy authentication
        - Multifactor authentication for admins
        - Multifactor authentication for all users
        - Multifactor authentication for Azure management
        * Microsoft also gives you an active warnings about preventing 99.5% of attacks if you try to turn these policies off

3. Security Management 
   1. Decommisioning Defaults:
      - Explicity disable Security Defaults
      - Explicity disable all three Microsoft-managed MFA policies
    2. Mirror Protection
       - Build custom Conditional Access policies (CA01, CA02) that replicate MFA protections but provide granular controls
      
Takeaway:  By moving to custom Conditional Access policies, I shifted from a rigid, 'block-everything' posture to a flexible, context-aware, customizable posture.
